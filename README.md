# Finary One (Sep 24) - Luxembourg Investment Portfolio Optimization

![Project Logo](images/finary_one.jpeg)

We have developed three model portfolios for our Luxembourg investment platform:

- **Aggressive**
- **Balanced**
- **Defensive**

## Objectives

Our goal is to create portfolios that offer:

- **Low Fees**: Minimizing costs to maximize net returns.
- **High Sharpe Ratio**: Achieving the best risk-adjusted returns.
- **Solid Annual Returns**: Ensuring consistent performance over time.

## Project Overview

We aim to optimize and backtest these portfolios over an extended period using only index data. By focusing solely on indices, we can streamline the investment process while maintaining robust performance metrics.

## Methodology

- **Portfolio Construction**: Building portfolios tailored to different risk profiles.
- **Extended Backtesting**: Analyzing performance over a longer historical period.
- **Index Utilization**: Using index data to simulate and optimize portfolio returns.
